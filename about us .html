        <strong>At Chowrasta Café, every cup of chai tells a story.</strong><br><br>
        Born from a love for India's bustling street corners and cozy tea stalls, we bring you the authentic flavors of tradition in a warm, inviting setting.
        <br><br>
        We believe cafés are more than just places to eat — they are spaces where conversations spark, friendships blossom, and memories are brewed.
        Our menu is a tribute to India's diverse tastes — from the spicy aroma of masala chai to the comfort of classic snacks — crafted with fresh ingredients and love.
        <br><br>
        Whether you're catching up with friends, taking a quiet break, or exploring new tastes, Chowrasta Café is your corner of happiness.
        <br><br>
